# Cyber-Threat-Detection-using-Machine-Learning

This was a hands-on, practical, assessment of skills for cyber threat detection application for my masters Applied machine learning module at Birkbeck College, University of London. 



The aim of this project was to build an effective classification model that allow us distinguish between cyber security threats and normal traffic.

The modelling data was done by using a reduced CLS portion of the Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion Dataset (AWID).

This was a complete end to to end project where a dataset was taken and and a workflow completed, consisting of:

1) EDA
2) Feature Generation using Neural Networks/PCA
3) Feature selection
4) Cross Validation of different algorithms
5) Evaluations through pipelines.


Results:

The second pipeline using Adaboost and Fclassif was the most succesful with a **96% accuracy** and a **time to build of 0.14 seconds**.

This project was awarded a **Distinction**.
