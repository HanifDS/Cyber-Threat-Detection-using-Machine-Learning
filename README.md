# Cyber-Threat-Detection-using-Machine-Learning

This was a hands-on, practical, assessment of skills for cyber threat detection application for my masters Applied machine learning module at Graduate School.



The aim of this project is build an effective classification model that allow us distinguish between cyber security threats and normal traffic.

The modelling data was done by using a reduced CLS portion of the Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion Dataset (AWID).

This was a complete end to to end project where we took a data set and completed a workflow of:

1) EDA
2) Feature Generation using Neural Networks/PCA
3) Feature selection
4) Cross Validation of different algorithms
5) Evaluations through pipelines.


Results:

The second pipeline using Adaboost and Fclassif was the most succesful with a 96% accuracy and a time to build of 0.14 seconds.

This project was given a **Distinction** for my Applied Machine Learning masters module at Birkbeck College, University of London.
